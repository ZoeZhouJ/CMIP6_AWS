    "As always, we begin by importing the necessary packages for our analysis. The packages that are new for this tutorial are `intake` and `intake-esm`, which are designed to facilitate importing complicated datasets stored on a remote server and quickly packing them up into Python objects that can be used for analysis. The `intake` package is designed to be flexible for all sorts of data science applications, but doesn't always work well with climate model output. That's where `intake-esm` comes in - this allows the functionality of `intake` to interface with netCDF files well, by integrating with `xarray` and `pandas`. \n",

There are a lot of these, and you don't need to worry about most of them right now!

But for reference here: the modeling center which created the CanESM5 is the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis. See the [Models vs Modeling Centers](https://climate-datalab.org/models-vs-modeling-centers/) explainer on the Climate DataLab site if you're curious about how this works!\n",
    "\n",
    "- `experiment_id`: This is the name of the specific type of \"experiment\" included in CMIP or ScenarioMIP. The ones you'll want here are `historical` (which is part of the CMIP \"activity\"), and one of the SSP future scenarios (which are part of ScenarioMIP). \n",
