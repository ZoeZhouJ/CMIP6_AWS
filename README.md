# Climate in the Cloud: Using AWS to Analyze CMIP6 Output

This repository contains tutorials dedicated to the use of cloud computing resources to create visualizations of output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6).

Contents are as follows:

- 1. Opening and Querying the CMIP6 Catalog.ipynb: Contains a detailed explanation of using the CMIP6 database holdings via AWS, with the "intake", "intake-esm", and "s3fs" packages. Also shows worked examples of constructing database queries at different levels of specificity.

- 2. Plotting a Time Series via AWS.ipynb: Loads the CMIP6 AWS database and pulls information from a specific set of simulations  from the CanESM5 (historical and SSP3-7.0 projection). Also shows the user a basic time series visualization.

- Workbook_CMIP6_AWS.ipynb: Companion workbook containing comments and text explanations of analysis steps in the tutorials in this repo, but with code left blank for the user to practice with.
